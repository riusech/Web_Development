    <h1><b>About Jon Arbuckle</b></h1>
    <img src="assets/jon-arbuckle.png" alt="jon-arbuckle with garfield">
    <p>Hi there everyone! My name is <u>Jon-Arbuckle</u>. I am 30 years old and I am a cartoonist tha lives in Muncie, Indiana. I am the proud owner of a cat name Garfield and dog named Odie. Garfield is fat, lazy and loves to eat, while Odie is a dog without a brain. Although my pets drive me <i>crazy</i>, I can't imaging life without them.</p>
    <p>I spend about halk my time going to the grocery store to buy enough foood to feed Garfield. I have to make sute to buy all of Grarfield's favortie foods, or else he'll get pretty grumpy. This includes milk, cheese, bread, ham, chicken wings, potato chips, pasta with marinara sauce, frozen pizzas, and <b>lots and lots</b> of lasagna. When I come home, Garfield usually attacks me and tries to eat everything in the grocery bag before I even have time to put it in the refrigerator. One time he ate evrything that I bought in 30 seconds, and I had to go back to the store to  buy some more food. <i> I wasn't too hampy about that.</i></p>
